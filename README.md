This is my LearnWeb3DAO Technical Assessment, I decided to use React and Javascript for my overall tech stack as that just seemed to be the most simplistic for the project at hand. The general user process is as follows:

1. User opens your website
2. User connects their Ethereum wallet
3. Website loads all LearnWeb3 and Buildspace NFTs owned by that address
4. Website displays all the images of those NFTs

It took some time and research for me to figure out how to deal with blockchain and NFTs with full stack development testing different frameworks and programming languages but I feel this end product was probably the most efficient.

as of now, there isn't a whole lot in terms of the design, but nothing some more time can't fix. In addition, the application can only support images right now but it wouldn't be difficult to implement an mp4 functionality for video NFTs.

Overall, super interesting and I had a really good time understanding and applying the research I learned over the last week and a half

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
